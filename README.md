# PyBer Analysis of Rural, Suburban, and Urban Data, and a Highlight of Jan - Apr 2019 Data
Upon completion of our initial project, V. Isualize has requested that we highlight data from rural, suburban, and urban ride-sharing. Specifically, she would like Total Rides, Drivers, Fares, and Averages highlighted for each. After retrieving each, I will create a line graph to highlight the data on a week to week basis from January 1st to April 28th, 2019.
## The Results
From the data, we can make multiple conclusions about ride_sharing in rural, suburban, and urban cities:
1. There are significantly more urban rides, with rural having the lowest
2. There are significantly more drivers in urban cities, with rural having the least
3. Urban cities generated significantly more fares, with rural generating the least
4. Rural cities had the highest average fare per ride, with urban being the lowest
5. Rural cities had the highest average fare per driver, with urban being the lowest
6. As shown by the graph, urban generating the most fares, suburban the second most, and rural the least is always true. From best to worst in fare generation, the order is always: urban, suburban, rural.
